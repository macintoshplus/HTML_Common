HTML_Common
==============

The HTML_Common package provides methods for html code display and attributes handling.

* Methods to set, remove, update html attributes.
* Handles comments in HTML code.
* Handles layout, tabs, line endings for nicer HTML code.

This package is based in the [original PEAR library](http://pear.php.net/package/HTML_Common), but the code has been 
updated to be compatible with newer versions of PHP.

The intention of this project is not to work as a modern alternative, but to provide support for legacy projects still
using this library. Please, consider migrating to newer alternatives if possible.

Updates
-------

* Compatible with PHP 7 and newer versions.
* Use of composer autoloader to replace includes.
